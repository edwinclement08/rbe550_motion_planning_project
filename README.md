# RBE550 Motion Planning Project - Planning Under Uncertainity

## Running

Most of the tooling is in, as you might have guessed, `/tools` directory.

To view runnable commands, read the Makefile in `/tools/Makefile`

A comprehensive run command will be of the form:

```bash
cd tools
make grid convert_to_pomdpx build_despot run_despot

```
